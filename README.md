# Prediction of sursival on the titanic using several ML Clasification

- Used Titanic data set from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) to built and compare a variety of ML classifiers with sckit-learn (logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machine, random forest) in order to predict survival of passengers on the titanic.
